# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Ran through the final HTML/CSS exercise for Colt's Full Stack Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** This was pretty remedial for me -- but the repetition helps cement some stuff in my head.  Bootstrap is deep enough where I did manage to learn some stuff I hadn't really employed in the past, so that's a plus.

### Day 2: October 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on a new template for DanBailey.net.  Got nav and alert box done.

**Thoughts:** This is going to be a good exercise with Bootstrap, again, customizing it.  I'm looking to replace the current template at my blog [danbailey.net](https://www.danbailey.net) with something I roll myself, and this seems like a good opportunity.
