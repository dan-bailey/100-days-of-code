# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Ran through the final HTML/CSS exercise for Colt's Full Stack Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** This was pretty remedial for me -- but the repetition helps cement some stuff in my head.  Bootstrap is deep enough where I did manage to learn some stuff I hadn't really employed in the past, so that's a plus.
